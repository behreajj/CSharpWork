# CSharpWork
 
This repository's original aim was to be roughly analogous to the library [Cam Z-Up](https://github.com/behreajj/CamZup/) for [Processing](https://processing.org/), except that it worked in conjunction with the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game development engine.

Because it has had to walk a line between independence from -- and compatibility with -- Unity's C# Scripting API, certain naming conventions were followed to avoid collisions. For example, `Quat` is short for `Quaternion`; `ClrGradient` is elongated from `Gradient`; and so on.

For anyone is transitioning from Unity to Godot due to recent developments, see the [GodotWork](https://github.com/behreajj/GodotWork) repository, still in development.
